      "description": "User Page Documentation <br> <br>How It Works (User Page) <br>1. User Access <br>● The user arrives at the Rule Reader interface— login required (if applicable). <br> <br>● A chatbot interface and/or a search bar with filters are available for querying rules <br>by manual, division, rule number, title, or keywords. <br> <br>2. Enter Query <br>● Users type in a search term (e.g., “Signal failure”, “HR leave rule”, or specific rule <br>number). <br> <br>● Alternatively, they can simply ask the chatbot a natural language question like <br>“Explain Rule 56” or “What is the leave policy for staff?” <br> <br>● Filters (if used) help narrow down results to specific manuals or divisions. <br> <br>3. Search & Processing <br>● The query is processed by the AI/NLP engine. <br> <br>● The system matches the input with indexed rules and documents previously <br>uploaded by the admin. <br> <br>● If the input is conversational (via chatbot), the AI interprets the context and refines <br>the search. <br> <br>4. Result Matching <br>● The system retrieves: <br> <br>○ The matched rule or section in its original form. <br> <br>○ A simplified, clarified explanation in plain language. <br> <br>○ Metadata such as Manual name, Division, Rule number, Section heading. <br> <br> <br> <br><br>5. Display Output <br>● The user sees: <br> <br>○ A clear explanation of the rule. <br> <br>○ Option to view the original text (expandable). <br> <br>○ Reference details for traceability. <br> <br>○ Option to download or view the full document (PDF/text). <br> <br>6. Optional Enhancements <br>● The system can: <br> <br>○ Suggest related rules or cross-references. <br> <br>○ Provide feedback buttons (“Was this helpful?”). <br> <br>○ Allow bookmarking/history for quick retrieval. <br> <br> <br>Role of the Chatbot <br>● The chatbot acts as a personal assistant for the user. Instead of browsing or <br>applying filters manually, the user can simply ask questions in natural language. <br> <br>● It makes the platform conversational and interactive, which is easier than <br>searching through rule numbers or documents. <br> <br>● The chatbot can: <br> <br>○ Interpret vague or incomplete queries (“Tell me about staff rules”). <br> <br>○ Guide the user by suggesting follow-up questions. <br> <br>○ Maintain context in a conversation, so the user doesn’t need to repeat details. <br> <br>○ Provide quick, concise clarifications while still linking to the original rule text. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>Example Conversation <br>User: “What is Rule 56?” <br> Chatbot: “Rule 56 refers to staff working hours. It states that... [summary]. You can find this <br>under HR Manual → Section 4 → Rule 56.” <br>User: “Okay, and what about leave policies?” <br> Chatbot: “Leave policies are covered in Rule 102. It states... [summary]. Would you like me <br>to show the original document?” <br> <br> Link : <br>https://southern-rail-rules-reader.vercel.app/ <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>Admin Page Documentation&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> <br>How It Works (Admin Page) <br>1. Admin Login <br> <br>○ The admin logs in with secure credentials to access the dashboard. <br> <br>2. Upload Rules/Manuals <br> <br>○ Admin can upload new rule documents (PDF, Word, or text format). <br> <br>○ While uploading, the admin selects the division or category to which the <br>document belongs. <br> <br>○ The system stores the document in the database under that division. <br> <br>3. Automatic Indexing <br> <br>○ Once uploaded, the system automatically scans and indexes the content. <br> <br>○ Rules are broken down into searchable units (by rule number, name, or <br>section). <br> <br>4. Manage Rules <br> <br>○ Admin can edit, update, or delete existing rules. <br> <br>○ If a rule is modified, the updated version is saved and linked. <br> <br>5. Search & Cross-Linking <br> <br>○ Admin can search rules manually using rule number, name, or keyword. <br> <br>○ The system shows which manual or division the rule is stored under. <br> <br>6. User Access Preparation <br> <br>○ Once the admin uploads and categorizes rules, they become accessible to <br>users on the user page. <br> <br>○ Users can then search and view clarified rules based on the structured data <br>provided by admins. <br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Link : <br>http://rule-clarifier-ai.vercel.app",

          "to": "User Page Documentation <br> <br>How It Works (User Page) <br>1. User Access <br>● The user arrives at the Rule Reader interface— login required (if applicable). <br> <br>● A chatbot interface and/or a search bar with filters are available for querying rules <br>by manual, division, rule number, title, or keywords. <br> <br>2. Enter Query <br>● Users type in a search term (e.g., “Signal failure”, “HR leave rule”, or specific rule <br>number). <br> <br>● Alternatively, they can simply ask the chatbot a natural language question like <br>“Explain Rule 56” or “What is the leave policy for staff?” <br> <br>● Filters (if used) help narrow down results to specific manuals or divisions. <br> <br>3. Search & Processing <br>● The query is processed by the AI/NLP engine. <br> <br>● The system matches the input with indexed rules and documents previously <br>uploaded by the admin. <br> <br>● If the input is conversational (via chatbot), the AI interprets the context and refines <br>the search. <br> <br>4. Result Matching <br>● The system retrieves: <br> <br>○ The matched rule or section in its original form. <br> <br>○ A simplified, clarified explanation in plain language. <br> <br>○ Metadata such as Manual name, Division, Rule number, Section heading. <br> <br> <br> <br><br>5. Display Output <br>● The user sees: <br> <br>○ A clear explanation of the rule. <br> <br>○ Option to view the original text (expandable). <br> <br>○ Reference details for traceability. <br> <br>○ Option to download or view the full document (PDF/text). <br> <br>6. Optional Enhancements <br>● The system can: <br> <br>○ Suggest related rules or cross-references. <br> <br>○ Provide feedback buttons (“Was this helpful?”). <br> <br>○ Allow bookmarking/history for quick retrieval. <br> <br> <br>Role of the Chatbot <br>● The chatbot acts as a personal assistant for the user. Instead of browsing or <br>applying filters manually, the user can simply ask questions in natural language. <br> <br>● It makes the platform conversational and interactive, which is easier than <br>searching through rule numbers or documents. <br> <br>● The chatbot can: <br> <br>○ Interpret vague or incomplete queries (“Tell me about staff rules”). <br> <br>○ Guide the user by suggesting follow-up questions. <br> <br>○ Maintain context in a conversation, so the user doesn’t need to repeat details. <br> <br>○ Provide quick, concise clarifications while still linking to the original rule text. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>Example Conversation <br>User: “What is Rule 56?” <br> Chatbot: “Rule 56 refers to staff working hours. It states that... [summary]. You can find this <br>under HR Manual → Section 4 → Rule 56.” <br>User: “Okay, and what about leave policies?” <br> Chatbot: “Leave policies are covered in Rule 102. It states... [summary]. Would you like me <br>to show the original document?” <br> <br> Link : <br>https://southern-rail-rules-reader.vercel.app/ <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>Admin Page Documentation&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> <br>How It Works (Admin Page) <br>1. Admin Login <br> <br>○ The admin logs in with secure credentials to access the dashboard. <br> <br>2. Upload Rules/Manuals <br> <br>○ Admin can upload new rule documents (PDF, Word, or text format). <br> <br>○ While uploading, the admin selects the division or category to which the <br>document belongs. <br> <br>○ The system stores the document in the database under that division. <br> <br>3. Automatic Indexing <br> <br>○ Once uploaded, the system automatically scans and indexes the content. <br> <br>○ Rules are broken down into searchable units (by rule number, name, or <br>section). <br> <br>4. Manage Rules <br> <br>○ Admin can edit, update, or delete existing rules. <br> <br>○ If a rule is modified, the updated version is saved and linked. <br> <br>5. Search & Cross-Linking <br> <br>○ Admin can search rules manually using rule number, name, or keyword. <br> <br>○ The system shows which manual or division the rule is stored under. <br> <br>6. User Access Preparation <br> <br>○ Once the admin uploads and categorizes rules, they become accessible to <br>users on the user page. <br> <br>○ Users can then search and view clarified rules based on the structured data <br>provided by admins. <br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Link : <br>http://rule-clarifier-ai.vercel.app"
