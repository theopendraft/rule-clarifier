            <p>a. At stations where signals are operated through centralized operation, the Station Master shall put back the departure signals to 'ON' and keep the signals at 'ON' by keeping the relevant slides/signal knob.</p>
            <p>b. In case a hot axle is detected after the loco of the train has already passed the despatch signal, the Station Master shall immediately attract the attention of the Guard by waving the red flag by day and red light by night in a wide arc left to right across the chest. Such waving of hand danger signal across the chest by all railway staff on duty shall be a clear indication to the Crew and Guard of the train that danger exists not on the permanent way but on the train itself.</p>
            <p>(Correction Memo No.01/2014 dated 14.07.2014)</p>
            <p>c. The Station Master shall advise the Gateman, if any, in the block section ahead to stop the train by waving the red flag by day and red light by night in a wide arc left to right across the chest. (Correction Memo No.03/2015 dated 01.07.2015)</p>
            <h4>2. On Double Line Sections.</h4>
            <p>The station Master will follow the same sequence for the stoppage of the train formation on which a hot axle has been detected.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Station Master shall not give line clear to a train coming from the direction in which the train having the hot axle has gone into.</p>
            <p>In case a train from the opposite direction has already entered the block section, the gateman, if any on the block section, would be advised to stop such a train coming from the opposite direction and advise the Loco Pilot of the situation.</p>
            <p>The Loco Pilot of the train coming from the opposite direction, after being so advised, shall proceed cautiously at a speed governed by feasibility, proximity of the other line, any topographical constraints, in such a manner that he can always stop short of an obstruction caused by the derailment of the train on which a hot axle was detected.</p>
            <h4>3. On Electrified Sections.</h4>
            <p>On Electrified sections the Station Master will also advise the Traction Power Controller and Traffic Controller simultaneously of a train formation having a hot axle not having been detected and when it is considered operationally safe, the traction power supply will be immediately switched off.</p>
            <p>If the train cannot be stopped by any means as mentioned above, then the Station Master in advance should be advised to stop and examine the train duly using the prescribed emergency signal bell code six pause one (000000-0). The Section Controller, Traction Power Controller also should be advised accordingly.</p>
            <p>After stoppage the Train examining staff or Guard and Loco Pilot should be advised to examine the train. In case it is decided by the Train Examining staff, or by the Loco Pilot that the Wagon or vehicle has to be detached for attention, the wagon or vehicle shall be detached accordingly.</p>
