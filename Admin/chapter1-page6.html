            <div class="note-title">Note:</div>
            <div class="note-item">1. Availability of a reasonable level of road access in the section is required for enabling substitution of trolley inspection by On-foot inspection. On some of the routes, which would mainly be situated in Ghat sections, this condition may not get fulfilled. Trolley inspection and On-foot inspection as per frequency for <strong>"Other Routes"</strong> would be followed on all such routes even in the category of <strong>"Routes having speed above 110 Kmph and Multiple Line Routes"</strong>. These sections would be identified and approved by PCE. While identifying these sections, the lowest unit would be a complete section under SSE/ P.Way (In-charge).</div>
            
            <div class="note-item">2. It would be desirable that in the absence of trolley, UTV/Rail Borne Maintenance Vehicle (RBMV) supplement the movement by road utility vehicle. This would be particularly useful for some of the work sites, such as AT welding work, and for repairs in emergency. Availability of UTV/RBMV would enable efficient utilization of the available manpower. Steps would be taken for early induction of UTV/RBMV on these routes.</div>
            
            <div class="note-item">3. Implementation of inspection as per schedule <strong>1 (i) and 2 (i)</strong> would be decided by PCE taking into consideration availability of infrastructure for required mobility. Till the time inspection as per schedule <strong>1 (i) and 2 (i)</strong> is implemented, inspection would be done as per schedule under <strong>1 (ii) and 2 (ii)</strong> for all the routes.</div>
