Specific items such as completeness and condition of fittings, greasing of ERC, toe load of ERC, soundness and squareness of PSC sleepers, creep in LWR track etc. and other scheduled inspections listed in the Table.<br>
                        2. Attendance of Gang, gang work, equipment, gang chart/ diary, and books with reference to prescribed schedule of track maintenance.<br>
                        3. Work done by minimum one gang in each SSE/P.Way (In-charge) jurisdiction every quarter and record the result of inspection.

                        <strong>Note:</strong><br>
                        (i) In case of double/multiple lines running closely parallel, inspection of all the lines would be covered in one push trolley/foot inspection as applicable; else, separate push trolley/foot inspection as applicable will be required for each group of such lines.<br>
                        (ii) For routes having speed above 110 Kmph and Multiple Line Routes, inspection by push trolley would preferably be under block protection. In case adequate numbers of blocks are not available, stipulated schedule of inspection would be completed predominantly through conduct of Foot Inspection.
