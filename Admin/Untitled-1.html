</div>

<div id="8">
    The "Indian Railways Permanent Way Manual (IRPWM)" was first published in the year 1986 after recommendation of 49th TSC. It has been reprinted later in the years 1999 and 2008 to incorporate Advance Correction Slips issued from time to time. The third and the last reprint of this Manual in July 2019 was inclusive of the Correction Slips up to No. 149.

    Railway Board vide letter No. 2013/CE-II/TK/IRPWM dated 24/09/2019 asked IRICEN to redraft IRPWM with a view to remove obsolete topics and material components which are not in use now and make it for only Broad Gauge by adding recent developments in P. Way for the guidance of field officials. Accordingly, Shri Ajay Goyal, the then Director, IRICEN along with a team of faculty members finalised the first draft of IRPWM keeping in view the mandate given by Railway Board. Thereafter Rly Bd vide letter No. 2013/CEII/TK/IRPWM dated 02/12/2019 nominated two members committee as under:

    Each committee then finalised the nominated chapters which were compiled by IRICEN and presented to TSC meeting held in Jan, 2020 at PURI. On recommendation of TSC, Rly Bd nominated a sub Committee comprising of Shri R. K. Bajpai, Sr Professor Track-1/IRICEN (Member and Convenor), Shri P K Garg, CTE/CR, Shri A K Jha, CTE/SCR, Shri Ashish Bansal, CTE/NR, Shri S. Mitra, CTE/SER, and Shri A M Rizvi, ED Track-2/RDSO as members to examine and submit the final draft. The final draft after initial vetting by RDSO was sent to Railway Board. Rly Bd suggested certain changes which were examined and incorporated by IRICEN. After final vetting by RDSO the redrafted IRPWM is approved by Railway Board (Member Engineering). The provisions of the LWR manual have also been amalgamated herein to make this Manual, a one stop source for all P. Way related matters. The Chapters have been logically re-arranged so as to cater for the day-to-day needs of the field officials. For Metre Gauge and Narrow Gauge track one can refer old IRPWM which was reprinted on July 2019.

    While revising the Manual, the provisions in the Indian Railway General Rules 1976, Indian Railways Code for the Engineering Department and Indian Railway schedule of Dimensions have been taken in to account. This redrafted edition incorporates all Advance Correction Slips up to No. 155 of the earlier Manual. The hitherto obsolete designations have been done away with and current designations of officials have been incorporated, viz. Gangman as Track Maintainer, Permanent Way Supervisor / Permanent Mistry (PWS/PWM) as JE(P.Way), PWI/PWI (In-charge) as JE/SSE(P.Way) Sectional or SSE(P.Way) In-charge. In a volume of this type, it is not possible to provide for every contingency that may arise during the course of the working, though every effort has been made to make the instructions comprehensive.
