            <div style="margin-top: 10px;">
                When working at a place from where an approaching train cannot be seen at least 600 metres away a Track Maintainer with hand signals should be sent out by the Gang Mate:
            </div>
            
            <div class="sub-item">
                <strong>(a)</strong> On double line in the direction of approaching trains,
            </div>
            
            <div class="sub-item">
                <strong>(b)</strong> On a single line in the direction the view is obstructed (in both directions if view is obstructed on both sides).
            </div>
            
            <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 30px;">
                It will be the duty of such Flagman to warn the Gang Mate by means of signals when a train is approaching.
