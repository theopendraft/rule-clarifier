                        3. Check to ensure that every man in the gang is aware of safety rules by examining them periodically at least once in two months.<br>
                        4. Routine check and review of inspection done by his subordinates.

                        (i) In case of double/multiple lines running closely parallel, inspection of all the lines would be covered in one push trolley/foot inspection as applicable; else, separate push trolley/foot inspection as applicable will be required for each group of such lines.<br>
                        (ii) For routes having speed above 110 Kmph and Multiple Line Routes, inspection by push trolley would preferably be under block protection. In case adequate numbers of blocks are not available, stipulated schedule of inspection would be completed predominantly through conduct of Foot Inspection.
